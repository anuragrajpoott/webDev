Using Postman to Test the APIs
You can use Postman to test the API endpoints for each of these projects. Here's a general guide to testing APIs with Postman:

Install Postman: Download and install Postman from Postman's official website.

Set Up Postman:

Open Postman and create a new Request.

Set the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) based on the API endpoint.

Enter the API URL (e.g., http://localhost:5000/auth/login).

Auth Project:

POST http://localhost:5000/auth/register - Register a new user.

POST http://localhost:5000/auth/login - Log in with registered credentials.

Blogs Project:

GET http://localhost:5000/blogs - Retrieve all blogs.

POST http://localhost:5000/blogs - Create a new blog post.

PUT http://localhost:5000/blogs/:id - Update a specific blog post.

DELETE http://localhost:5000/blogs/:id - Delete a specific blog post.

Todo Project:

GET http://localhost:5000/todos - Retrieve all to-do tasks.

POST http://localhost:5000/todos - Create a new task.

PUT http://localhost:5000/todos/:id - Update a specific task.
